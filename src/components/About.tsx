          I am an Indian writer for television and screen who has been asking the question 'Why not?' to everything since I was a kid. As my parents did not have the answers to my constant questioning of the world, I started investigating my queries in my daydreams. Those daydreams have now taken the form of a lifelong quest for storytelling. I settled on this as my life's purpose only after majoring in journalism where I learned the useful inverted pyramid and made a bunch of zero-budget student films.

          Although I hold an MFA degree in Dramatic Writing from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, I hold my (functionally dysfunctional) family more dear as they are my biggest source of inspiration in life and my writings. I tend to write all of my stories as letters to my loved ones. I also like to make sure that each story of mine has humor and specificity at its core. Once upon a time, I used to feel like I am traveling the world when I consumed a story a day, and that's what I wish and hope for the folks who experience my work.

          And one last thing to know about me, I plan to build my own secret library one day so that I can daydream (and write) in peace.
